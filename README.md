# ⚡ EV Adoption Forecasting

This project forecasts **Electric Vehicle (EV)** adoption using historical registration data from Washington State (2017–2024).  
By analyzing trends in **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** and **Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)** across counties and vehicle types, we predict upcoming EV growth to guide **charging infrastructure planning** and **sustainable transportation development**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
EV adoption is growing rapidly, but without accurate forecasting, cities risk inadequate charging infrastructure, leading to user dissatisfaction and slower sustainability progress.  
This project uses a regression-based forecasting approach to help policymakers and planners prepare for future demand.
