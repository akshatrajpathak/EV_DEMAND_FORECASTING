# EV_DEMAND_FORECASTING
This project predicts future electric vehicle adoption in Washington State using historical registration data. By analyzing trends in BEVs and PHEVs, it provides forecasts to help planners and policymakers optimize charging infrastructure and support sustainable transportation growth.
# ‚ö° EV Adoption Forecasting

This project forecasts **Electric Vehicle (EV)** adoption using historical registration data from Washington State (2017‚Äì2024).  
By analyzing trends in **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** and **Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)** across counties and vehicle types, we predict upcoming EV growth to guide **charging infrastructure planning** and **sustainable transportation development**.

## üìå Problem Statement
EV adoption is growing rapidly, but without accurate forecasting, cities risk inadequate charging infrastructure, leading to user dissatisfaction and slower sustainability progress.  
This project uses a regression-based forecasting approach to help policymakers and planners prepare for future demand.
